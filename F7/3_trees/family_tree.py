# Recursive functions are useful for tree data.
# **Using recursive functions with tree data is not for the exam.**

# This data represents my ancestors:
# For simplicity, only the names of the great-grandparents are shown.
ancestor_tree = (
    (
        ("Alice", "Bob"),      # Grandparent 1's parents
        ("Carol", "David")     # Grandparent 2's parents
    ),
    (
        ("Eve", "Frank"),      # Grandparent 3's parents
        ("Grace", "Hendrik")     # Grandparent 4's parents
    )
)

# Suppose we want to count how many great-great-grandparents?
# (the ones with names)



# Find the longest name in the tree?
