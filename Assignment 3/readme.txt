Assignment 3 (A3), CD100A, HT25.
Ben Blamey

As before, this assignment is presented in the form of Python scripts (.py files).
These both (a) contain the instructions, and (b) are updated and edited as you work on the solution.

There is a directory of scripts and files to accompany each lecture.

Do not use any external packages for this assignment.

Lecture 10 is covered in the next assignment.

As you work on the assignment, you will need to modify parts of it, and write parts that are missing where instructed.
You will need to write both python code, and written answers (which you write with comments in the spaces shown).
Don't modify the overall structure of the files in these cases.

Write in Swedish or English as you wish.

When you have completed each script, it should execute without errors.

There are some questions marked optional/difficult, intended to be more challenging, and go beyond the syllabus for this course. You are recommended to attempt these questions, but only if you are comfortable with the previous questions.

The objective is for us to assess your understanding of the material in the lectures -- please avoid using advanced topics not covered (yet) on the course. You risk failing the assignment.

For submission, create a new ZIP file (compressed archive with extension .zip) containing all the modified files, in their original directory structure,
and submit that on canvas (you simply need to Zip/Compress the parent directory when you are finished).

Plagiarism: Work individually on this assignment. It is reasonable to discuss individual questions from the worksheet with
other students, after you have both attempted them, but also encourage fellow students to figure out things for
themselves and seek help from teachers if they need it. Do not share your entire solution with another student, or
vice versa, even after you have finished the course. Please do not publish the worksheet (or your solutions), e.g. online.
Remember that you can also be penalized for letting another student copy your answers, even if you did the work yourself.
There is no need to "check" answers with other students. Everyone can hand in their own work, get it marked, and get
 feedback. If you wish to use AI, do so responsibly, sparingly, to check your own understanding, and get help when you
 are really stuck, in the same way you would ask a teacher. Remember this assignment is a chance to practice questions
 for the exam (which is offline). Using AI irresponsibly will leave you unprepared for the remainder of the course,
 your exam, and your subsequent courses.
