# We can also redirect the STDIN and/or STDOUT to files:

python3 01_print_input.py < some_input_text.txt  > output.txt

# That way, instead of reading from the keyboard, the text gets read from a file.
# and output, if redirected, goes to a file instead of the terminal.

# The advantage of this is that it works for any command-line application.
# ...and its really simple!

# The *disadvantage* of this technique that it will not allow us to simultaneously:
# read from a file *and* the keyboard.
# or print to a file *and* the screen.
# ...and we need to do this in the project!
