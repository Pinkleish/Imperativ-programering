# At the beginning of the course, we used print(..) to print to the terminal:

print("hej")

# We also used input to read from the keyboard:
my_name = input("What is your name?")

print(f'Hej {my_name}')

# Recall the data is always written as a string.
a_string = input("Enter an integer:")

# This will fail if it is not a valid integer.
my_integer = str(a_string)
