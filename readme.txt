Assignment 2. CD100A, HT25.
Ben Blamey

This assignment is presented in the form of Python scripts (.py files). We begin to work with Python in script form,
and also practicing working with files and ZIP archives.

These both (a) contain the instructions, and (b) are updated and edited as you work on the solution.
There is one script for each lecture. Lecture 6 is covered in the next assignment.

As you work on the assignment, you will need to modify parts of it, and write parts that are missing where instructed.
You will need to write both python code, and written answers (which you write with comments in the spaces shown).
Don't modify the overall structure of the file.

Write in Swedish or English as you wish.

When you have completed each script, it should execute without errors.

The objective is for us to assess your understanding of the material in the lectures -- please
avoid using advanced topics not covered (yet) on the course. You risk failing the assignment.

The exit() function is invoked after each question, so that you can concentrate on one question at a time.
When you have completed one of the questions, you can remove or comment out the exit() to work on the next one.

For submission, create a new ZIP file (compressed archive with extension .zip) containing only your three .py files,
and submit that on canvas.

Plagiarism: Work individually on this assignment. It is reasonable to discuss individual questions from the worksheet with
other students, after you have both attempted them, but also encourage fellow students to figure out things for
themselves and seek help from teachers if they need it. Do not share your entire solution with another student, or
vice-versa, even after you have finished the course. Please do not publish the worksheet (or your solutions), e.g. online.
Remember that you can also be penalized for letting another student copy your answers, even if you did the work yourself.
There is no need to "check" answers with other students. Everyone can hand in their own work, get it marked, and get
 feedback. If you wish to use AI, do so responsibly, sparingly, to check your own understanding, and get help when you
 are really stuck, in the same way you would ask a teacher. Remember this assignment is a chance to practice questions
 for the exam (which is offline). Using AI irresponsibly will leave you unprepared for the remainder of the course,
 your exam, and your subsequent courses.

P.S. Have you finished the worksheet and looking for an extra challenge (outside the course content)?
Create your ZIP file using the command prompt: zip (for mac/linux),
On Windows you can use Compress-Archive (Windows PowerShell), or install the WSL.
